# About

Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie. ðŸ‘‹ [Graphic designer](https://jamieharris.co) by day, incorrigible bookworm by night (and also by day).

{{ site.title }} is a [[digital garden]] that serves as a platform for my learning and creative pursuits. It's a hybrid between a reading log / blog / note-taking app, with no goal beyond giving myself some structure to create more. 

## Technologies

It makes sense that this project has already been through many forks in the stream. My favorite thing Iâ€™ve done on the web was hand-coding a site in textpattern, back in the day. I wanted to get back to that sense of play, a space that was my own. Mandy Brown of A Working Library convinced me I could handcode again, a very book-and-thoughts-centric site like her own, but this time based in Jekyll.

I wanted it to be less blog, more rhizomatic though: enter mental nodes. Maxime Vaillancourt's [Digital Garden Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), but after a few weeks of bumping my head against wall about how to include both Tufte CSS and a book library, I lucked up on alisa.wtf who had already forked a template and done both those things.

I forked it further, overhauled what I wanted, and here we are.

## Visual style 

I use three typefaces, all through [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/):

- Freight Text Pro
- <span class="sans">Freight Sans Pro</span>
- <span class="mono">Nitti</span>

I also use a couple of Maxime's original styling, like deeplinks and hover states.

## Site structure

### Essays

Essays are longform content where I develop an opinion or point of view. Each essay has a growth stage associated with it to help give an idea of how much thought I've put into it so far, and they're also organized by <span class="mono">last updated</span> since they're worked on over time.

<ul class="list-x sans">
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> Freshly planted ideas that need more exploring.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> Has a good foundation. More growth is expected.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> Fairly established. Minor edits might still happen. </li>
</ul>

### Notes

Notes are collections of information, observations, and sources for random topics that catch my eye. They're organized alphabetically to make it easy to find a particular topic.

### Journal

The journal is my outlet for everything else I feel like sharing. Right now, it's divided into **thoughts** and **visuals** where it houses photos, life updates, and streams of consciousness.

They're organized chronologically because timeliness -- i.e. the whatabouts of my life as a timestamp of that moment -- is the most valuable part about it. 


## Inspiration

This site embraces the philosophy of a [[digital garden]], and much of it is built on ideas I picked up from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/). She notes [Mike Caufield](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) as being the original source of the concept, but I credit her with advocating for it and making it accessible. 

I have also drawn inspiration from:

- Linus at [The Sephist](https://thesephist.com/posts/), especially since he has a [creative blog](https://linus.coffee) too
- [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/)
- [Chinarut's Digital Greenhouse](https://www.notion.so/Chinarut-s-Digital-Greenhouse-9b31c7ba8efc4bf9adcfa17a38c841ff)
