# Alisa's digital garden

This is the code that powers [alisa.wtf](https://www.alisa.wtf), my digital garden. It's a hybrid between a creative portfolio / blog / notebook. The site itself is inspired by other digital gardens, but as far as I know, the Plant/Root structure is pretty unique to mine.

Feel free to fork and use as your own. I try to keep my code neat but I'm not an engineer. You can ask me questions if you want, but I am barely hacking my way through this site as it is, so there are no promises on how well I can answer anything.

## Credits

This site started with [Maxime Vaillancourt's digital garden template](https://github.com/alisasgithub/digital-garden-jekyll-template), and grew to fit the use cases for my personal garden. I especially use their backlink plugin a lot.

Lots of the CSS comes from [Edward Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), and I use a couple of icons from [Iconify](https://github.com/iconify/iconify).
